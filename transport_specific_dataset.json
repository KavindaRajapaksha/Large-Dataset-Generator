Firstly, it's a good idea to book your tickets in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, as seats can fill up quickly. You can book tickets at the bus station or through a travel agent. Secondly, be prepared for crowds and long lines, especially at popular bus stations like Colombo's Fort Bus Station. Thirdly, consider purchasing a ticket for an air-conditioned bus, which is generally more comfortable and less crowded than non-AC buses. Fourthly, be mindful of your belongings and keep an eye on your luggage, as bus stations can be busy and crowded. Lastly, don't be afraid to ask for help or directions from locals, who are generally very friendly and willing to assist. Additionally, it's a good idea to have some local currency, Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), with you, as not all bus stations or ticket counters may accept foreign currency or credit cards.
